          <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an
            introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and
            more!
          </p>
          <h2>2 Core Components</h2>
          <p>
            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
            code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
            let’s cover how components work in React Native.
          </p>
          <h2>3 React Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source
            library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the
            most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
          </p>
          <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
          <p>
            <span class="parag-main-word"><b>components.</b></span
            > The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
            friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="parag-main-word"><b>JSX.</b></span
            > React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
            elements inside JavaScript like so:
            <mark>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</mark>. The
            React docs have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can
            refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
            variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
            name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
            <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="parag-main-word"><b>props.</b></span
            > Props is short for “properties”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="parag-main-word"><b>state.</b></span
            > While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
            components render, state is like a component’s personal data
            storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
            that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
            memory!
          </p>
          <h2>4 Handling Text Input</h2>
          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every
            time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
            function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: <span>&#127829;</span>. So the
            sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "<span
              >&#127829; &#127829;</span
            >".
          </p>
